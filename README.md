CaeserCipher is a cryptographic technique. 
In cryptography, Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. 
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
To keep important information unknown to third parties but allow interception by required parties, Caeser cipher is one of the techniques used.
